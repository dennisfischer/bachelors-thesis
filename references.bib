@inproceedings{msdetours,
 abstract = {Innovative systems research hinges on the ability to easily instrument and

extend existing operating system and application functionality. With access to

appropriate source code, it is often trivial to insert new instrumentation or

extensions by rebuilding the OS or application. However, in today's world of

commercial software, researchers seldom have access to all relevant source code.

We present Detours, a library for instrumenting arbitrary Win32 functions on x86

machines. Detours intercepts Win32 functions by re-writing target function

images. The Detours package also contains utilities to attach arbitrary DLLs and

data segments (called payloads) to any Win32 binary. While prior researchers have

used binary rewriting to insert debugging and profiling instrumentation, to our

knowledge, Detours is the first package on any platform to logically preserve the

un-instrumented target function (callable through a trampoline) as a subroutine

for use by the instrumentation. Our unique trampoline design is crucial for

extending existing binary software. We describe our experiences using Detours to

create an automatic distributed partitioning system, to instrument and analyze

the DCOM protocol stack, and to create a thunking layer for a COM-based OS API.

Micro-benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of the Detours library.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
